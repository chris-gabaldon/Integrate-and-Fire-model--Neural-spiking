# Integrate-and-Fire-model--Neural-spiking
he Integrate and Fire model is developed, one of the earliest models to emulate the firing behavior of a neuron. This model is based on conceptualizing a neuron as an RLC electrical circuit, and its theoretical explanation can be found in Wikipedia. In the ipynb I studied the behaviour of that model (atractors,parameters,etc),
